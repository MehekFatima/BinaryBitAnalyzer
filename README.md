# BinaryBitAnalyzer

This Java program calculates the count of set bits (binary 1s) in the binary representation of a given integer N. It also determines the position of the first set bit and the position of the last set bit. The logic uses bitwise operations and iteration to traverse through the binary representation of N. Special handling is included to account for the least significant bit at the 0th position.

Output Format:

The output is a string in the format count#firstSetBitPos#lastSetBitPos, where:

	•	count is the total count of set bits.
	•	firstSetBitPos is the position of the first set bit encountered.
	•	lastSetBitPos is the position of the last set bit encountered.

How to Use:

	1.	Enter the number N, any number greater than 0.
	2.	Run the program to see the count of set bits, the position of the first set bit, and the position of the last set bit.
